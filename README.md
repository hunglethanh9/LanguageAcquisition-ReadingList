# LanguageAcquisition-ReadingList

This is a list of papers that might be useful if you're a computer scientist and you're trying to create an artificial agent that can learn a language or a concept in a manner identical to human learning. Before you start working with complicated RNNs, LSTMs and other complicated deep-learning architecture, I think it is important that you understand the basics of how humans learn a concept or a language. This would mean reading a few papers written by Psychologists and Cognitive Scientists. 

I have divided this list into a number of sections.
