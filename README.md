# LanguageAcquisition-ReadingList

This is a list of papers that might be useful if you're a computer scientist and you're trying to create an artificial agent that can learn a language or a concept in a manner identical to human learning. Before you start working with complicated RNNs, LSTMs and other complicated deep-learning architecture, I think it is important that you understand the basics of how humans learn a concept or a language. This would mean reading a few papers written by Psychologists and Cognitive Scientists. 

I have divided this list into a number of sections. 

## Psychology, Cognitive Science and Linguistics
* A history of Acquisition and Bickerton's Bioprogram [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1120&context=dlls]

## Simple Machine Learning (Naive Bayes, etc.) - Very Important



## Complicated Deep-Learning stuff (important, but read the other material before you get to this)


## Some other useful machine learning literature which will be useful - (feature correlation, curse of dimensionality etc.)
